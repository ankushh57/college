        <p>The GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) architecture
            The GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) architecture is a framework used in mobile telecommunication systems to provide end-to-end communication. It is divided into three main subsystems: Mobile Station (MS), Base Station Subsystem (BSS), and Network and Switching Subsystem (NSS). Additionally, it incorporates an Operation and Support Subsystem (OSS) for network management.
